# The Happiness Equation: A Global Perspective

## Overview
This project leverages data from the World Happiness Report to explore the factors influencing global happiness. Through rigorous data analysis, we uncover the complex interplay between happiness and various societal metrics like GDP per capita, social support, and life expectancy.

## Project Structure
- Data/: Contains the dataset used for the analysis.
- Code/: Includes all R scripts for data processing.
- Results/: Visualizations and summary statistics from the analysis.
- The_Happiness_Equation_report.pdf/: Documentation and detailed project report.
- requirements.txt: Lists all R packages required to run the analysis.

## Environment Setup
To run the analysis, ensure you have R installed on your machine. Clone this repository and install the required R packages listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Data
The `Data/` directory contains the `Dataset_1633638_ADC_Final_Assigment.csv` file used for our analysis.

## Usage
Navigate to the Code/ directory and execute the R scripts in order. Start with data cleaning, followed by exploratory data analysis, and finally, run the modeling script. Detailed instructions are provided in each script file.

## Results
Our analysis reveals key predictors of happiness across countries, including economic factors, social support, and health. Findings are presented through comprehensive visualizations and statistical summaries, providing insights into the dynamics of global happiness. The `Results/` directory includes visualizations and model summaries that illustrate our findings.
