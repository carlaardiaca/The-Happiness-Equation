# The Happiness Equation: A Global Perspective

## Overview
Welcome to "The Happiness Equation: A Global Perspective" project! In this project, we delve into the intricate dynamics of happiness on a global scale, utilizing comprehensive data from the World Happiness Report. Our aim is to illuminate the multifaceted factors that contribute to overall happiness levels across different nations. Through meticulous data analysis, we endeavor to uncover the nuanced interconnections between happiness and key societal indicators such as GDP per capita, social support networks, and life expectancy. By shedding light on these relationships, we strive to deepen our understanding of what truly fosters happiness worldwide, offering valuable insights for individuals, policymakers, and societies at large.
